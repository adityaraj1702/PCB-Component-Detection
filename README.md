# PCB Component Detection Project

## Overview
The PCB Component Detection project is an application designed to identify and annotate various components on printed circuit board (PCB) images. Users can upload images of PCBs, and the application will process these images to detect components, returning an annotated image with the detected components and a tabulated list of findings. [Website link](https://pcb-component-detection.firebaseapp.com/)

## Features
- **Image Upload:** Users can upload PCB images from their device.
- **Component Detection:** The application processes the uploaded image to detect various PCB components.
- **Annotated Image:** The detected components are highlighted on the image.
- **Tabulated Findings:** A table summarizing the detected components is generated and displayed to the user.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK: Ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine. You can download it from [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev).
- Dart: Dart is required to run Flutter applications. It is included with Flutter SDK.
- A compatible code editor: VS Code or Android Studio is recommended.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pcb_detection_flutter.git
   cd pcb_detection_flutter
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Configuration
- **Backend Setup:** Ensure your backend for image processing and component detection is set up. You might need to configure the API endpoints in your Flutter application.
- **API Keys:** If your backend requires API keys or authentication, ensure these are securely stored and accessed in your Flutter application.

## Usage
1. **Launch the app** on your device or emulator.
2. **Upload a PCB image** by clicking the upload button.
3. **Wait for processing:** The app will send the image to the backend for component detection.
4. **View the results:** The annotated image with detected components will be displayed, along with a table summarizing the findings.
